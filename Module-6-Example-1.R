table(clinical.trial$center)



# For example 2, we need to create a logical vector indicating whether or not a patient is under 60 or not. 
# We can then pass that into the table function. Also, since there are missing ages, we might be interested 
# in seeing those in the table also. It is shown both ways by setting the “useNA” argument to table.

## a logical vector is created and passed into table
table(clinical.trial$age < "60")

## the useNA argument shows the missing values, too
table(clinical.trial$age < 60, useNA = "always")
