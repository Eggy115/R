# In order to assess how quickly polyester decays over time in landfills, a researcher buried strips of the material in the soil
# for different lengths of time and then tested the force required to break them (as a measure of decay). Lower breaking strength 
# is indicative of decay


# Test whether or not the breaking strengths of polyester strips buried for 2 weeks is greater than the breaking strengths of
# those buried for 16 weeks. 

# Perform the test at the Î±=0.10 level of significance.

# First read the data as a dataframe into your R memory
