# An Additive Main effects and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) effects model

# A Bayesian version of the AMMI model as specified here: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13253-014-0168-z.pdf (JosseE et al JABES 2014)
# Andrew Parnell / Danilo Sarti

# In this file we simulate from the AMMI model specified in the paper above, then fit it using JAGS. Finally we present a worked example
# There are two jags code parts below. The first is for a single interaction decomposition effect. The second is for a general AMMI model which is more realistic

# Some boiler plate code to clear the workspace, set the working directory, and load in required packages

# Description of the Bayesian model fitted in this file

# Notation
# Y_ij = response (e.g. yield) for genotype i and environment j, i = 1, ..., I genotypes and j = 1, ..., J environments
# mu is the grand mean
# alpha_i is the genotype effect
# beta_j is the environment effect
# lambda_q is the q-th eigenvalue q = 1,.., Q of the interaction matrix
# Q is the number of components used to model the interaction. Usually Q is fixed at a small number, e.g. 2
# gamma_{iq} is the interaction effect for the q-th eigenvector for genotype i
# delta_{iq} is the interaction effect for the q-th eigenvector for environment j
# E_{ij} is a residual term with E_{ij} ~ N(0, sigma^2_E)
# Usually these models have quite complicated restrictions on the gamma/delta/lambda values but Josse et al show that these are not fully necessary

# Likelihood
# Y_{ij} ~ N(mu_{ij}, sigma^2_E)
# with
# mu_{ij} = mu + alpha_i + beta_j + sum_{q=1}^Q lambda_q*gamma_iq*delta_jq

# Priors
# mu ~ N(m, s_mu^2)
# alpha_i ~ N(0, s_alpha^2)
# beta_j ~ N(0, s_beta^2)
# lambda_q ~ N+(0, s_lambda^2) with lambda_1 < lambda_2 < ... < lambda_Q
# Note: N+ means positive-only normal
# gamma_{1q} ~ N+(0, 1)
# gamma_{iq} ~ N(0, 1)
# delta_{jq} ~ N(0, 1)
# sigma_E ~ U(0, S_ME)
# All of the above hyper-parameter values are fixed
