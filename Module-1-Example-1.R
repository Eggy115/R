# Read and Writing to Files, see Slides of Lecture 1 for additional info. 
# Reading from comma separated volume (CSV) file. We assume that our data is stored in a simple CSV text file.  
# Provide the specific file path on your computer  like this   days<-read.csv("/home/kia/Desktop/Example_Data.csv")
# or have the file in your current working directory
# This command will read the data into a special data type named "data frame".

days <- read.csv("Datasets/Example_Data.csv", header = FALSE)

# To convert and flatten data from a data frame you can use the unlist command. 
my.days <- unlist(days, use.names = FALSE)


# my.days is now a simple vector data type that I can work with. 
# generate a histogram form data 
hist(my.days)
